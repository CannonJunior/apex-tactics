# Implementation Rule Exceptions

This document tracks any exceptions to the established implementation rules and the reasoning behind each decision.

## Rule Exception Log

### Exception #1: Initial Project Setup
**Rule Violated**: None (baseline establishment)
**Date**: 2025-06-24
**Component**: Project foundation setup
**Decision**: Created supporting documentation files (XML.md, EXAMPLES.md, MCP.md) before implementing core systems
**Reasoning**: These files are required for proper documentation of subsequent development and establish patterns before code implementation begins
**Impact**: No negative impact, enables better organization going forward

### Exception #2: [Template for future exceptions]
**Rule Violated**: [Which specific rule]
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Component**: [System/file affected]
**Decision**: [What was done differently]
**Reasoning**: [Why the exception was necessary]
**Impact**: [What effects this has on the project]

## Rule Adherence Status

### ‚úÖ Rules Currently Being Followed
- **Rule 1**: Creating CLAUDE.md in every new folder
- **Rule 2**: Keeping CLAUDE.md under 100 lines unless critical
- **Rule 3**: Not exceeding 200 lines without permission
- **Rule 4**: Using XML tags in CLAUDE.md files (XML.md created)
- **Rule 5**: Using <file_map> tags to point to files
- **Rule 6**: Creating EXAMPLES.md for code patterns (created)
- **Rule 7**: Using @ syntax for file tagging
- **Rule 8**: Planning to use parallel tasks for complex operations
- **Rule 9**: Will auto /compact at 30% context remaining
- **Rule 10**: Will enter plan mode at end of day
- **Rule 11**: Creating MCP servers when possible (MCP.md created)
- **Rule 12**: Let it rip! (full implementation mode)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Rules Requiring Attention
- **Rule 8**: Will implement when we reach file reading phases
- **Rule 9**: Monitoring context usage
- **Rule 10**: Will implement at end of development day

### üìã Exception Guidelines

When documenting exceptions:
1. Be specific about which rule is being violated
2. Provide clear reasoning for the decision
3. Document any potential negative impacts
4. Consider if the exception suggests a rule modification
5. Get approval for significant deviations before implementation

## Rule Modification Requests

None currently pending.
