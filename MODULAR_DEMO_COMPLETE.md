## Architecture Comparison

### Before (apex-tactics.py)
```
Monolithic Design:
â”œâ”€â”€ 8 classes in 957 lines
â”œâ”€â”€ Tight coupling between systems
â”œâ”€â”€ Mixed data/logic/presentation
â”œâ”€â”€ Difficult to test components
â””â”€â”€ Limited extensibility
```

### After (Modular ECS)
```
Component-Based Design:
â”œâ”€â”€ 7+ components per entity
