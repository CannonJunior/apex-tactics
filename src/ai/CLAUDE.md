## Difficulty Management System

### Performance Tracking
```python
@dataclass
class PlayerPerformance:
    win_rate: float
    average_turns_per_battle: float
    unit_loss_rate: float
    tactical_efficiency: float
    recent_performance_trend: float
```

### Adaptive Scaling
The system monitors player performance and adjusts AI capabilities:

#### Performance Metrics
- **Win/Loss Ratio** - Overall success rate
- **Battle Efficiency** - Turns to victory, units preserved
- **Tactical Patterns** - Movement, positioning, targeting choices
- **Learning Curve** - Improvement rate over time

#### Adjustment Mechanisms
- **AI Reaction Speed** - How quickly AI responds to threats
- **Strategic Depth** - Lookahead planning horizon
- **Risk Assessment** - Aggression vs. caution balance
- **Resource Management** - Efficiency of ability usage

### Dynamic Difficulty Features
```python
class DifficultyManager:
    def adjust_difficulty(self, performance: PlayerPerformance):
        """Dynamically adjust AI difficulty based on player performance"""
        
    def get_ai_parameters(self) -> AIDifficultyParameters:
        """Get current AI configuration"""
        
    def should_scale_difficulty(self) -> bool:
        """Determine if difficulty adjustment is needed"""
```

## Leader AI System

### Strategic Leadership
The Leader AI manages groups of units with strategic coordination:

#### Leadership Capabilities
- **Unit Coordination** - Synchronized attacks and movements
- **Formation Management** - Tactical positioning and formations
- **Resource Allocation** - Ability and item usage across team
- **Objective Prioritization** - Dynamic goal setting

#### Leadership Styles
- **Aggressive** - Focus on offense and direct confrontation
- **Defensive** - Emphasize protection and area control
- **Tactical** - Balanced approach with situational adaptation
- **Opportunistic** - Exploit weaknesses and positioning errors

### Command Hierarchy
```python
class LeaderAI:
    def plan_turn(self, available_units: List[Unit]) -> TurnPlan:
        """Create coordinated plan for all units"""
        
    def execute_plan(self, turn_plan: TurnPlan):
        """Execute coordinated unit actions"""
        
    def adapt_strategy(self, battlefield_state: BattlefieldState):
        """Adjust strategy based on current situation"""
```

## MCP Integration

### Tactical AI Tools
Model Context Protocol integration provides enhanced reasoning:

#### Available Tools
- **Position Analysis** - Evaluate tactical positions
- **Threat Assessment** - Analyze danger levels
- **Strategy Planning** - Generate tactical plans
- **Pattern Recognition** - Identify player patterns

#### MCP Capabilities
```python
# Tactical analysis through MCP
def analyze_position(board_state: dict) -> dict:
    """Analyze current tactical position"""
    
def plan_optimal_move(unit_data: dict, battlefield: dict) -> dict:
    """Generate optimal move for unit"""
    
def assess_threats(unit_position: dict, enemy_positions: list) -> dict:
    """Evaluate threat levels and priorities"""
```

### Integration Benefits
- **Enhanced Reasoning** - Sophisticated tactical analysis
- **Pattern Learning** - Advanced pattern recognition
- **Strategic Planning** - Multi-turn planning capabilities
