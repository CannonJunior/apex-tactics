# Camera Controls Implementation

## Overview

The practice battle now has **fully functional camera controls** that match the implementation in `demos/phase4_visual_demo.py`.

## Implementation Details

### WASD Camera Movement
The practice battle implements the exact same camera movement system as the phase4 demo:

```python
# WASD Camera movement (same as phase4_visual_demo.py)
camera_speed = 5
camera_move = Vec3(0, 0, 0)
if held_keys['w']:
    camera_move += camera.forward * time.dt * camera_speed
if held_keys['s']:
    camera_move += camera.back * time.dt * camera_speed
if held_keys['a']:
    camera_move += camera.left * time.dt * camera_speed
if held_keys['d']:
    camera_move += camera.right * time.dt * camera_speed

camera.position += camera_move
```

### Camera Controller Integration
The practice battle also maintains the `CameraController` from apex-tactics.py for advanced features:

- **Orbit Mode**: Camera orbits around battle center with mouse control
- **Free Camera Mode**: WASD movement with mouse look
- **Top-down Mode**: Fixed overhead tactical view
- **Zoom Control**: Scroll wheel zoom in orbit mode
- **Keyboard Rotation**: Arrow keys for camera rotation

### Dual Implementation
The practice battle uses **both** camera systems:

1. **CameraController** - For advanced camera modes and orbit controls
2. **Direct WASD Movement** - For immediate responsive camera movement (same as phase4_demo)

This provides the best of both worlds: advanced camera features from apex-tactics.py plus the responsive WASD movement from the phase4 demo.

## Controls Summary

### Primary Camera Movement (Like phase4_visual_demo.py)
- **W**: Move camera forward
- **S**: Move camera backward  
- **A**: Move camera left
- **D**: Move camera right

### Advanced Camera Controls (From apex-tactics.py)
- **1**: Orbit camera mode
- **2**: Free camera mode
- **3**: Top-down camera mode
- **Mouse Drag**: Rotate camera (orbit mode)
- **Scroll Wheel**: Zoom in/out (orbit mode)
- **Arrow Keys**: Keyboard camera rotation

### Battle Controls
- **Left Click**: Select unit or tile
- **Space**: End turn
- **Enter**: Show battle log
- **ESC**: Exit battle

## Testing

### Automated Tests
```bash
# Test camera implementation
uv run test_camera_controls.py

# Test full integration
uv run test_practice_battle.py
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Start the demo
uv run src/ui/screens/start_screen_demo.py

# Click "PRACTICE BATTLE" button
# Use WASD keys to move camera around the battlefield
# Try different camera modes with 1/2/3 keys
```

## Verification Results

✅ **All camera control patterns match phase4_visual_demo.py**
- Identical WASD movement implementation
- Same camera speed (5 units)
- Same movement calculation patterns
- Proper time.dt scaling for frame-rate independence

✅ **Integration with existing systems**
- CameraController from apex-tactics.py fully integrated
- Seamless transition from start screen to battle
- Proper cleanup and return to menu

✅ **Enhanced functionality**
- Multiple camera modes available
- Professional tactical game camera system
- Responsive controls for all user interaction needs

## Technical Notes

The implementation uses a **hybrid approach**:

1. **Update Loop**: Direct WASD camera movement for immediate response
2. **Camera Controller**: Advanced features like orbit mode and mouse control
3. **Input Handling**: Unified input system that handles both battle and camera controls

This ensures that users get the familiar, responsive WASD camera movement they expect from the phase4 demo, while also having access to advanced camera features for tactical gameplay.

## Files Modified

- `src/ui/screens/practice_battle.py` - Added WASD camera controls to update loop
- `src/ui/screens/start_screen_demo.py` - Improved practice battle integration  
- `test_camera_controls.py` - Verification script for camera implementation
- `PRACTICE_BATTLE_README.md` - Updated documentation

The practice battle now provides a **complete tactical combat experience** with professional camera controls that match the quality and responsiveness of the phase4 visual demo.
