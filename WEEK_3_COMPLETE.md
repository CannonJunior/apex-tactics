## Key Technical Achievements

### **MCP Tool Integration**
```python
# AI agents can now interact with game through standardized tools
tool_registry = MCPToolRegistry(action_manager)

# Query battlefield state
result = tool_registry.execute_tool('get_battlefield_state')
battlefield = result.data

# Execute unit action
tool_registry.execute_tool('queue_unit_action', 
    unit_id='orc_chief', 
    action_id='fireball',
    target_positions=[{'x': 5, 'y': 3}],
    priority='HIGH'
)
```

### **AI Orchestration**
```python
# Master agent coordinates multiple AI units
orchestration_agent = OrchestrationAgent(action_manager)

# Execute coordinated AI turn
result = orchestration_agent.execute_ai_turn_sync(['orc1', 'orc2', 'goblin1'])

# Gets: battle analysis → strategic planning → unit coordination → execution
```

### **Individual Unit AI**
```python
# Each unit has sophisticated AI controller
ai_controller = UnitAIController(
    unit_id="orc_chief",
    personality=AIPersonality.AGGRESSIVE,
    skill_level=AISkillLevel.STRATEGIC
)

# Makes tactical decisions based on context
decision = ai_controller.make_decision(assignment="eliminate_hero_mage")
```

### **Seamless Integration**
```python
# AI integrates smoothly with existing ActionManager
ai_manager = AIIntegrationManager(action_manager)

# Register units for AI control
ai_manager.register_ai_unit("orc_chief", AIUnitConfig(
    personality=AIPersonality.TACTICAL,
    skill_level=AISkillLevel.ADAPTIVE
))

# Execute AI turn coordinates with game flow
result = ai_manager.execute_ai_turn(['orc_chief', 'orc_warrior'])
```
