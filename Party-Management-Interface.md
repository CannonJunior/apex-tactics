The party management interface in Final Fantasy Tactics is an essential part of game mechanics that allows players to interact with their team of characters during gameplay. The primary goal of such an interface is to enable players to assign battle roles, select allies, and otherwise manage the party roster. Here's a detailed breakdown for a coding agent implementing this functionality:

### Main Interface Structure
The main party management interface can be divided into two main sections:
1. **Party List Section**: This section lists all characters currently in the player’s party.
2. **Character Role Assignment Section**: This area allows players to assign battle roles, move characters between party slots, and perform other operations.

### Party List Section
- **Characters Displayed**: Characters should be displayed with their name, class (or job), HP, MP, level, and possibly their current equipped weapons and magic items.
- **Display Format**: Characters could be listed in rows or columns. Rows can show each character’s details, while a column format might list characters side by side with some common controls at the bottom.

### Character Role Assignment Section
This section is where players assign battle roles to party members. Each role (e.g., Warrior, Archer, Wizard) can have specific attributes and strengths that affect gameplay. Players should be able to:
- **Assign Roles**: Choose which characters will play the different roles during battles.
- **Remove Characters from Party**: Allow for removing non-battle-ready or otherwise unusable characters from active party slots.
- **Move Characters Between Slots**: Enable moving characters between different positions in the party list (e.g., swapping Warrior with Archer).

### Key Functionalities
1. **Assigning Battle Roles**:
   - Users should be able to select a character and assign them to a specific role or allow dynamic assignment based on battle needs.

2. **Character Selection Controls**:
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality for characters to reposition them within the party list.
   - Include buttons allowing users to quickly add or remove characters from their party, either by inviting new ones or sending existing characters back to the recruitment screen.

3. **Confirmation and Error Handling**:
   - For significant changes (like assigning a role), include confirmation prompts before executing the change.
   - Provide clear error messages if an attempt is made to select a character in a non-available state (e.g., party full, already assigned).

### User Interface Implementation
- Use standard GUI elements like buttons, sliders, checkboxes, and text boxes for common operations. Buttons can be used for assignment, removal, swapping roles or positions.
- Implement animations if supported by the system to enhance user experience when characters are moved or assigned.

### Example Code Snippet
Here’s a basic example of how you might structure some of this logic:

```python
class CharacterManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.party = []

    # Add a character to the party. This could be part of a recruitment screen.
    def add_character(self, character):
        if len(self.party) < 6:  # Assume a maximum party size of 6 characters for simplicity
            self.party.append(character)
            print(f"{character.name} has been added to your party.")
        else:
            print("Your party is full. Cannot add more characters.")

    def assign_role(self, character_name, role):
        for char in self.party:
            if char.name == character_name and len(char.roles) < 2:  # Assume each character can have up to 2 roles
                char.assign(role)
                print(f"{character_name} has been assigned the {role} role.")
            else:
                print("The character is already assigned or cannot be reassigned.")

    def move_character(self, source_pos, dest_pos):
        if 0 <= source_pos < len(self.party) and 0 <= dest_pos < len(self.party):
            self.party.insert(dest_pos, self.party.pop(source_pos))
            return True
        else:
            print("Invalid positions provided. Move aborted.")
            return False

# Example usage of CharacterManager class
character_manager = CharacterManager()
character_manager.add_character(Character('Zoe', 'Warrior'))
character_manager.assign_role('Zoe', 'Archer')
character_manager.move_character(1, 0)
```

This code snippet outlines the basic structure and functionality needed for managing a party in Final Fantasy Tactics. More complex features such as saving/loading the party list between sessions or integrating with battle logic would need additional development.

By following this detailed plan, you can create an efficient and user-friendly party management system that matches the requirements of the game's interface.
