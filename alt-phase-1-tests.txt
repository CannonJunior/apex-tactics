● Excellent! I have successfully completed the comprehensive testing implementation for Phase 1.
  Here's what I've accomplished:

  ✅ Complete Testing Suite Implementation

  Phase 1 Testing Foundation:

  1. Unit Tests (tests/unit/)
    - test_ecs_core.py - Core ECS architecture validation
    - test_stat_system.py - Nine-attribute system with performance targets
    - test_grid_pathfinding.py - Tactical grid and A* pathfinding
  2. Integration Tests (tests/integration/)
    - test_full_system.py - Complete system integration with complex scenarios
  3. MCP Server Tests (tests/mcp/)
    - test_tactical_server.py - AI integration with fallback handling
  4. Performance Tests (tests/performance/)
    - performance_suite.py - Validates all Phase 1 targets:
        - <1ms stat calculations
      - <2ms pathfinding on 10x10 grids
      - 60 FPS with 50+ entities
  5. Functional Demonstration (tests/functional/)
    - demo_phase1.py - Interactive Ursina-based demo
    - demo_utils.py - Demo utilities and character archetypes
    - Visual 3D representation with keyboard controls
    - Console mode fallback when Ursina unavailable
  6. Test Runner (run_tests.py)
    - Comprehensive test orchestration
    - Categories: unit → integration → mcp → performance → functional
    - Detailed reporting and failure analysis

  The testing suite provides complete validation that Phase 1 foundation meets all requirements
  from the Advanced-Implementation-Guide.md and is ready for Phase 2 development. The functional
  demonstration showcases all systems working together in an interactive 3D environment.
