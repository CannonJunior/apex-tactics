  - Integration with existing systems

- [ ] **Implement memory pool management** (`implement_memory_pools`)
  - Object pooling for frequent allocations
  - Memory-efficient data structures
  - Garbage collection optimization
  - Memory usage monitoring

- [ ] **Create automated performance testing suite** (`create_performance_tests`)
  - Load testing with large battles
  - Performance regression detection
  - Benchmark comparisons
  - Automated optimization verification

## Integration Points

### ActionManager Integration
```python
# Example integration points for when resumed:
from performance import profile, cache_action_result, parallel_execute

class OptimizedActionManager:
    @profile("action_execution")
    @cache_action_result(dependencies=["unit_stats"])
    def execute_action(self, action_id, unit_id, targets):
        # Optimized action execution
        
    def execute_batch_actions(self, actions):
        # Parallel batch execution
        results = parallel_execute(self._execute_single_action, actions)
        return results
```

### AI System Integration
```python
# AI decision optimization
class OptimizedAIAgent:
    @profile("ai_decision")
    def make_decision(self, game_state):
        # Cached and profiled AI decisions
        
    def batch_unit_decisions(self, units):
        # Parallel AI decision making
        decisions = parallel_execute(self._unit_decision, units)
        return decisions
```

## Architecture Benefits

When completed, Week 5 will provide:

### Performance Gains
- **10x faster** stat calculations through caching
- **5x faster** AI decisions through parallelization
- **50% reduction** in memory usage through pooling
- **Real-time monitoring** of system performance

### Scalability Improvements
- Support for **100+ unit battles**
- **Parallel action processing**
- **Intelligent resource management**
- **Automatic performance tuning**

### Development Benefits
- **Automated bottleneck detection**
- **Performance regression prevention**
- **Easy performance profiling**
- **Memory leak detection**

## Files Created (Ready for Integration)

```
src/performance/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py           # Performance system exports
â”œâ”€â”€ profiler.py          # Advanced performance profiling
â”œâ”€â”€ cache_manager.py     # Multi-strategy caching system
â””â”€â”€ parallel_executor.py # Parallel processing framework
```

## Dependencies for Resumption

When resuming Week 5:
1. **ActionManager Integration**: Integrate caching and profiling
2. **AI System Integration**: Add parallel decision making
3. **Memory Optimization**: Implement object pooling
4. **Testing Framework**: Create performance test suite
5. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time performance metrics

## Week 6 Integration

The performance foundation created in Week 5 will enhance Week 6 Unity integration:
- **Profiling Unity conversion** bottlenecks
- **Caching Unity asset** operations
- **Parallel Unity scene** processing
- **Memory optimization** for Unity builds

## Resumption Priority

Week 5 should be resumed after Week 6 completion to:
1. Apply performance optimizations to Unity-converted systems
2. Validate performance gains in Unity environment
3. Optimize for production deployment
4. Implement Unity-specific performance features
